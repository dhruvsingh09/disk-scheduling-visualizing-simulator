ðŸ§  Disk Scheduling Simulator
This is a Streamlit web application that visually simulates various Disk Scheduling Algorithms with an animated graph! ðŸš€
It helps you understand how disk head movement happens for different algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, and CLOOK.


âœ¨ Features
Choose from 6 disk scheduling algorithms.

Input custom disk request queues and initial head positions.

Animated visualization of head movement over time.

Displays the total seek time after simulation.

Clean and simple Streamlit-based interface.


ðŸ“œ Algorithms Implemented

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

CSCAN (Circular SCAN)

LOOK

CLOOK (Circular LOOK)
